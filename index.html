                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>I graduated as a Master of Science in Computer Engineering. This year I finished a Data Science
                    Bootcamp at Cambridge Spark in London. After the Bootcamp, I continued learning on my own to deepen
                    my knowledge in Software Development and Data Science.</p>

                <p>I worked for a media company for six years, where I was part of a small team with big
                    responsibilities.

                    I worked on different types of projects, including software development and Machine Learning, but my
                    main
                    responsibility was the accounting and sale application support.
                    I worked on a web application for the Marketing department using Python,
                    the development and administration of the database using MySQL, that application improved clients
                    and sales management. I also developed Python scripts to synchronize applications, solving
                    inconsistencies on management reports; and to monitor the servers of the company.
                    I also worked on a web application in PHP for the Archive Department to manage and search
                    the location of the newspapers in the archive, replacing the paper management system.</p>

                <p>I can motivate myself because I want to be constantly learning new technologies and how to
                    apply them to real challenges, to grow professionally in my career.</P>

                <P>I am currently living in London. I have the right to work unrestrictedly in the UK, and I will never
                    require visa sponsorship.
